# Inside Earth

An interactive web app that shows various systems of Earth and how they are dependent on each other, and live natural events happening in different parts of the world.

Here at Inside Earth, we'll be leveraging the power of NASA's Earth observation satellites to gain a deeper understanding of earth's natural events and how they impact our lives. By analyzing satellite and sensor data, we can see how our planet is changing and how these changes influence each other.
